Perfect, **Kempoverse** is a fantastic name 👊🌌

Let’s plug that into what we already designed so it feels cohesive and intentional.

---

## 1. Branding: “Kempoverse”

**Name:** `Kempoverse`
**Tagline ideas (pick one or remix):**

* *“Your personal universe of kempo knowledge.”*
* *“A living encyclopedia of your karate.”*
* *“One place for every kempo, combo, and form.”*

You can show tagline under the logo on desktop, and only on the home screen on mobile to keep things clean.

## 2. Top bar & home screen

### Top bar

* Left: minimal text mark
  **`Kempoverse`** in mono font, small caps or uppercase.
* Optional tiny sublabel in gray: `personal karate encyclopedia`.

Example layout:

```txt
KEMPOVERSE
personal karate encyclopedia
```

On mobile:

* First line: `KEMPOVERSE`
* Second line: very small gray: `kempo notes & encyclopedia`

Right side:

* A tiny circular indicator:

  * Hollow circle (○) when not logged in.
  * Filled red circle (●) when logged in (edit enabled).

## 3. Logo / icon ideas (very simple, sumi-style)

Since you want sumi / brush / Japanese minimalism and the name is Kempoverse, a couple of lightweight ideas:

1. **Circle + kanji-style mark**

   * A rough, hand-drawn **enso**-style circle (representing “verse” / universe).
   * Inside or overlapping, a simple **fist silhouette** or **“拳” (ken / fist)**-like stroke.
   * Use only black and red on a white circle; no gradients.

2. **Belt + orbit**

   * A horizontal strip implying a **belt**, with a small red “planet” dot orbiting above.
   * Belt = kempo; orbit = verse / universe.

3. **Initial-based**

   * Stylized `KV` or just `K` drawn like a brush stroke, with a tiny red circle above the stem like a sun.

You don’t have to implement a complex logo right away; you can just:

* Use `KEMPOVERSE` in your mono font.
* Add a small red circle to the left as the “icon”.

Example:

```txt
● KEMPOVERSE
```

(● is your brand dot.)

## 4. Design system tweaks with the new name

From the prior design:

### Colors (unchanged)

* Ink Black: `#050608`
* Paper White: `#F5F2EC`
* Deep Red: `#C1121F`
* Gray: `#9CA3AF`

Use **Deep Red** as the accent for:

* Logo dot
* Primary button (Save)
* Active category chips

### Typography with name

* **App title (logo text)**

  * Font: `IBM Plex Mono` / `JetBrains Mono`
  * Style: uppercase: `KEMPOVERSE`
  * Letter-spacing: slightly increased.

* **Home title**

  * `KEMPOVERSE` at top center (or top-left).
  * Under it in smaller text: one of:

    * `your personal karate encyclopedia`
    * `kempo notes and forms, all in one place`

---

## 5. Where the name appears in the UI

1. **Document title / favicon**

   * `<title>Kempoverse</title>`
   * Favicon: small red circle on black, or a simple white fist on red.

2. **Home screen**

   * Top:

     * `KEMPOVERSE`
     * `Browse your kempo, forms, and defenses.` (small subtitle)
   * Then: category tiles (History, Techniques, Forms, Self-defense, Basics).

3. **Entry detail header**

   * Above the entry title in tiny uppercase gray:

     * `KEMPOVERSE / TECHNIQUE / KEMPO`
   * Example:

     * `KEMPOVERSE / TECHNIQUE / KEMPO`

4. **Footer (tiny)**

   * `Kempoverse · private training notes` or similar.
