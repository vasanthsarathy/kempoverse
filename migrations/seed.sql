## Overview
The first kata in American Kenpo, focusing on basic stances, blocks, and strikes. Performed in a straight line.

## Pattern
All movements are executed along a straight line (north-south).

## Movements

### Opening
1. **Attention stance** - Feet together, hands at sides
2. **Ready stance** - Step out to horse stance, hands in guard position

### Main Sequence
1. **Step Forward (North)** - Right foot forward to right neutral bow
2. **Inward Block** - Left inward block
3. **Reverse Punch** - Right reverse punch

4. **Step Forward** - Left foot forward to left neutral bow
5. **Inward Block** - Right inward block
6. **Reverse Punch** - Left reverse punch

7. **Turn (Face South)** - Pivot 180° to right neutral bow facing south
8. **Downward Block** - Left downward block
9. **Reverse Punch** - Right reverse punch

10. **Step Forward** - Left foot forward to left neutral bow
11. **Downward Block** - Right downward block
12. **Reverse Punch** - Left reverse punch

### Closing
13. **Cover Out** - Pivot back to horse stance facing north
14. **Return to Attention** - Step together, return to attention stance

## Key Concepts
- **Hip rotation** - Power comes from the hips, not just the arms
- **Breathing** - Exhale sharply with each strike
- **Stances** - Keep low, 50/50 weight distribution in neutral bow
- **Focus** - Kiai on final reverse punch

## Training Notes
This form builds muscle memory for basic defensive and offensive techniques. Practice slowly first, focusing on proper form before adding speed.',

  '# The Leopard

## Attack
Two-handed front choke (opponent facing you, both hands on your throat)

## Defense Sequence

### 1. Pin and Strike
- **Pin hands** - Immediately pin opponent''s hands to your chest with both of your hands
- **Right knee strike** - Drive right knee into groin or abdomen
- Keep pinning their hands - don''t let them pull back

### 2. Clear and Control
- **Step back** - Drop back with right foot to 6 o''clock into a left neutral bow
- **Clear hands** - Execute left outward extended block to clear their right arm
- **Grab wrist** - Control their right wrist with your left hand

### 3. Strike and Finish
- **Right leopard strike** - Strike to throat with right leopard paw strike
- **Right knee** - Drive right knee to opponent''s ribs or solar plexus
- **Takedown** - Push/pull to take them down

## Key Points
- **Immediate response** - Pin hands INSTANTLY, don''t think
- **Protect the throat** - Pinning prevents them from crushing your windpipe
- **The knee strike** - This breaks their structure and loosens their grip
- **Leopard paw** - Curved fingers, strike with knuckles to throat (careful in practice!)

## Common Mistakes
- Trying to pull hands off instead of pinning them first
- Not committing to the knee strike
- Weak leopard strike - needs to be sharp and targeted

## Practice Tips
- Have partner apply light pressure, focus on speed of pin
- Practice the leopard strike slowly on a target
- Flow through the entire sequence without stopping',
